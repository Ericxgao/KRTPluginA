Ideas and Progress
===

Focus Areas
---

* Sync/Trigger/Patterns/PLL (in time, in tune)
* VCO and Envelope (a.k.a a voice ... ideas not yet done?)
* Trigger Repeater (Number and Length) (part sequencing)
* Delay Line Effects (...)
* Global Subgroup TX/RX Addition Bus (cable cleaner)
* Sync to Returned Trigger plus Trigger Count (live play assist)
* CV seed trig->CV rand (seems like a chaos challenger)
* ... the list goes on

Umm ...

f_ = (2.0620112372482157e+44*f[i-10]-1.832898878564529e+45*f[i-9]+7.217039339343297e+45*f[i-8]-1.6496089933227736e+46*f[i-7]+2.4056797847951367e+46*f[i-6]-2.3094525972362604e+46*f[i-5]+1.443407876801168e+46*f[i-4]-5.498696694805404e+45*f[i-3]+1.0310056373750902e+45*f[i-2])/(2.2911237200293967e+43*1.0*h**0)

I like it for a next simple module. `Ω` ... font ... Ω.
