Ideas and Progress

Focus Areas
---

* Sync/Trigger/Patterns/PLL (in time, in tune)
* VCO and Envelope (a.k.a a voice ... ideas not yet done?)
* Trigger Repeater (Number and Length) (part sequencing)
* Global Subgroup TX/RX Addition Bus (cable cleaner)
* Sync to Returned Trigger plus Trigger Count (live play assist)
* CV seed trig->CV rand (seems like a chaos challenger)
* Something using custom widgets
* ... the list goes on

Names

I like it for a next simple module. `Ω` ... font ... Ω. ?
