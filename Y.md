# Scenario 1
## "I want to see some of the features"

So gate the top left gate to a drum or something. Goto `NOW` to check and select channel 1 for editing. Button `1/1`. Ok, now goto `PAT` to see the edit mode of the channel.

Place notes by pressing buttons. This get you a pattern of 16 in length. So you want a 64?

Go to `SEQ` and decide which of the 4 groups of 16 you want different (useually the last), and press button `2T/4` to select the last 16 pattern and a desire for it to play the second pattern.

Run the pattern until the last set of 3 light illuminate, as this places you in the last 16. Then select `PAT` mode and maybe `RUN` to stop at the right place. Now you can edit any channel of pattern 2 and use any mode (other than `PAT`) to select one of the three hot select patterns (patterns decided in `SEQ` mode) as the sequence progresses.

Use `MUTE` mode to mute channels, and these are global. That introduces you to the main features. You have 16 patterns of 16 channels with 12 of them which can be put on a hot select rythum of 64 in length.

You can select any of the 16 to be any of the stored 12, but `SEQ` mode will only place the changed one into the active quarter of the full 64.

Want to copy a sequence. Find it and `RUN` (stop) on it, then press `CPY` and a reference to it will be made note of. Even changing the pattern will change the copy as it is a reference to one of the 16. Then use `SEQ` mode and find the pattern of the 16 (by the hot selects or replacing a hot select by being on it and pressing the wanted pattern number). Button `PST` will paste a copy. There is one exception to this rule, and that is in `PAT` mode (so for whole patterns don't be in `PAT` mode on a `PST`), or only the channel last selected in `NOW` mode is overwritten by the channel selected when `CPY` was pressed. The indicators on `CPY` and `PST` indicate same pattern and same channel.

Notes: When not in `PAT` mode the triples are the hot selects (alter the quarter of 64 when they occur). Changing a hot select HAS to be when you are within the quarter of 64 and in `SEQ` mode, as you otherwise would be changing the pattern for the hot select that is currently in play.
