## A

Plate 18 dB filter. Band pass phased ring mod. Other ins and outs with different order are available. The ring modulation is between a low and high pass for a band pass with harmonics effect.

## Mu

Time dependant calculus on a summing junction with series truncation distortion. This is complex to explain. Much better to listen and fiddle.

## T

Pitched time stretch and matched trigger sync delay. Spools and then plays back faster such that the overall waveform is produced at two different frequencies.

## L

Synchronized delay with shortening. To synchronize with a buffer but delayed by a bar or some other timed quantity.

## D

Exponential VCA and future estimator with error? A very simple utility.

## R

Simple mixer split. Put a signal on another as an insert.

## Om

Clock distribution randomiser. Generates a random-ish sequence of length 64 and depending on the left-most displayed letter outputs a trigger when the clock is high or low.

## V

Envelope VCA and CV producer. A bit weird. An experiment in module design.

## F

24 dB morph filter. A 2D interpolation and extrapolation between 4 classic analytic filter responses of Bessel, Butterworth, Linkwitz and Legendre. Includes an interpole distortion effect and morphing to the inverse filter.

## W

Gate transposer. Kind of a tuning plug-board for gate triggers.

## Y

Triple sequencer. Nice but complex to operate. Try the online help.

## O

Triple parabolic skew feedback oscillator. An experimental module.

## S

Clock to CV generator. Needs MIDI clock, cont, stop and start. Produces a time based CV.

## E

Simple AR envelope with VCA. Nice. Gained modulation out.

## X

Oversampled wave-folder. A lot of fizz in such a little module.

## M

Emphasis and de-emphasis filter. Default is RIAA and inverse. This module has large gain. WARNING!

## Q

Quantum gravimitator. Imitates a coupled gravity quantum idea. I really shouldn't explain. Just play.

## C

A set of three attenuverters with mixing. Kind of useful chainable mixer. Includes LPF per channel.

## U

Sample and hold quantizer. Simple.

## B

Crossbar performance switch. Remembers internal routing for performance switching.

## J

All-pass filter and phaser. Has an LFO built-in.

## K

Phase modulation oscillator.

## H

Base gimpathizer. An organ with phase modulation. Bass how low can you go?

## I

Clock divider with downbeat extract.

## G

Compressor with control outs. Has a low pass peaking filter.
